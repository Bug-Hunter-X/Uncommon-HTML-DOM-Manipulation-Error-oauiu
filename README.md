# Uncommon HTML DOM Manipulation Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in handling dynamic content updates in HTML using JavaScript.  Specifically, it showcases the issue of attempting to access elements before they're fully parsed into the Document Object Model (DOM) and the incorrect appending of the dynamically created element.

## The Problem

The `bug.html` file shows an incorrect approach to adding content dynamically to the page. The script attempts to modify elements before they are fully added to the page's DOM.
